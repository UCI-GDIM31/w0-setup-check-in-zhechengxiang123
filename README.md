# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Zhecheng Xiang, you can also call me Johnson, my pronouns is he/him. I like to play fps game with friends, and the games that I played most are CounterStrike, Apex Legend and Rainbow Six Siege. I had not really had a chance to experience with the game development but I am looking forward to give it a try. If I had a chance to build a game, I would like to build an fps game since I had played a lot for this kind of game.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class? I want to get a chance to experience how to build a game and understand how things were made in the game, also, I want to practice teamworking skills as some project will need to work as a team.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class? I had not really had experience with programing, so I am afraid that I will get lost.
